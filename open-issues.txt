1) creating a investment action through blaze ds fails --> because the persist --> also does the persist for an instrument
--> this was done to enable public void buy(InstrumentInfo iinfo, double amount, Date dateOfBuy, MoneyValue costs) on Portofolio
--> and then simply call Portofolio.persist (cascading everything that is needed)
--> how to solve?

see:
    @ManyToOne(cascade={CascadeType.PERSIST}) // AG:good idea? no because it makes that if we persist a new investmentaction, that then the instrument is persisted as well (even in the case when it is a detached object!)
    private Instrument instrument;

2) see manual notes ...
